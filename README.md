# Automated Building Inspection System

## Overview

🚀 This project is dedicated to finding innovative solutions for the manual detection of defects or damages in building walls, a process known for its resource-intensive and time-consuming nature. Our proposed solution aims to establish an automated inspection system that efficiently identifies areas requiring maintenance or repair.

## Implementation

🤖 The system utilizes a mobile robot in conjunction with ROS (Robot Operating System) packages and tools for seamless data management from various sensors. Diverse algorithms are integrated to perform comprehensive analysis and inspections. Machine learning algorithms are incorporated to analyze input images from the camera, swiftly identifying cracks or structural defects.

## Remote Access and Reporting

📊 One of the key features of the automated inspection system is the ability to access data and results remotely. Users can obtain a detailed and comprehensive report on their building's condition, facilitating informed decision-making.

## Objectives

🏗️ The primary objectives of this project are to enhance building safety, optimize maintenance procedures, and prevent long-term structural damage. We believe our solution will revolutionize building inspection practices, offering a more efficient and precise approach to structural assessments.
